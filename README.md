This Jupyter Notebook implements a deep learning approach to classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The study leverages transfer learning and ensemble learning to enhance classification accuracy.

Objectives
Improve classification accuracy of histopathological images for lung and colon cancer.
Utilize transfer learning with pre-trained models (VGG-16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121).
Combine multiple models through ensemble learning to enhance diagnostic reliability.
